I would like to make these changes:

1. A task should contain these fields:
Customer, department, date, hours and description
(a customer can have zero or more departments)

2. I don't need projects, and the view of "Recent Time Entries" and the "Active Tasks".

3. The Dasbord should keep the top menu with the menu and also still showing the stats buttons

4. The area Below the stats-buttons should be divided into two sections (side-by-side)
Section 1, should contain the task form, so i quickly can make new tasks.
Section 2, should contain the last 10 task entries, and maybe something else

5. Keep the CRUD.
